# Txt-fx Example

Set up a server to run this example.

Something like [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) works.

```
npm install -g live-server
```

Then `CD` into `txt-fx` and in the root folder run:
```
live-server
```

The project should then be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
